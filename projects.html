            <p> In recoginition of National Bike Month, facilitated through the National Bycyclists of America,
                I was tasked with creating a public-facing ArcGIS StoryMap that demonstrates the city of San Marcos bicycle facilities, listed
                information regarding our planning practices as they pertained to bicycling and transportaion safety, and a live survey that allows users to submit geotagged photos of themselves enjoying their bicycles throughout town.</p>

            <p>For my Planning Practicum course we participated in a learning service program in which students are matched with real world
                clients. Our class was partnered with the Texas Great Springs Project, a non-profit land conservation group in central Texas.
               Our group was tasked with studying flood resilience as it related to a particular section of land that GSP was in the process
              of conserving. We calculated a gallon estimate for flood capacity and estimated the conservation could save billions of dollars
             flood prevention. </p>
